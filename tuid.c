/* Q. What is this?
 * A. A TUID is like a UUID (it conforms to UUID v4) but instead of being fully random it is prefixed with
 *    the time since epoch in microseconds, a sequence number (if generating more than one per microsecond, or
 *    waiting for clock rollback to catchup), and a node id.
 *
 * Q. Why would use use this over a UUIDv4?
 * A. UUIDv4 is completely random, so if you have a table with a lot of entries using UUIDv4 in an index leads to
 *    some performance issues. The main issue is new rows being inserted can cause an update to an index in a random
 *    location. This defeats caching of index entries. By ensuring the ids are generally monotonically increasing
 *    the entries added will be locally at the "head" of the index and multiple inserts will benefit from cache
 *    locality. (This benefit also extends in general in that most data that is related is created at the same time.)

/* Q. Why does seq exist?
 * A. Clock sync can (in theory) cause time to move backwards by a small amount. When that happens we fall back
 *    on sequential generation of ids (plus random because time could repeat if the server was reset and the clock
 *    was set back). Using 256 per microsecond helps prevent the id space from running into the future too much
 *    as we wait for the wall clock to catch up with our last seen time.
 *
 * An example: Say at time 1000us the clock moves back 100us and then 5 id's are generated over the next 100us. Those
 *   ids would be given seq numbers of 0,1,2,3,4 against clock 1000us (last is used to ensure our view of the clock
 *   doesn't rewind even if the system's view of the clock did). The next id is generated at time 1001us (after
 *   the system time has "caught up") with seq 0.
